This is my escape. I'm running through this world
And I'm not looking back
'Cause I know I can go where no one's ever gone
And I'm not looking back

[Pre-Chorus]
But how will I know when I get there
And how will I know when to leave?
We've all gotta start from somewhere, and it's right there for me
The possibilities are never-ending

[Chorus]
I see it, I see it, and now it's all within my reach
Endless possibility
I see it, I see it now; it's always been inside of me
And now I feel so free, endless possibility

[Verse 2]
And so I'll carry on; my time to shine has come
I feel it!
As fast as I can go, straight to the top I know
You'll see it!

[Pre-Chorus]
So please wake me up when I get there
It feels like I'm lost in a dream
I know in my heart that it's my time, and I already see
The possibilities are never-ending

[Chorus]
I see it, I see it, and now it's all within my reach
Endless possibility
I see it, I see it now; it's always been inside of me
And now I feel so free, endless possibility

[Bridge]
Drop that smile, 'cause you're beaten again
No, this is where my journey begins
You're losin' speed â€” You're losin' your flow
But inside me is a power you'll never know
Then let it out; it's inside you
Better all stand back, 'cause I'm coming through

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
I see it, I see it, and now it's all within my reach
I see it, I see it now; it's always been inside of me

[Chorus]
I see it, I see it, and now it's all within my reach
Endless possibility
I see it, I see it now; it's always been inside of me
And now I feel so free, endless possibility


[Outro]
(Endless possibility) Endless possibility
(Endless possibility) Endless possibility `;
